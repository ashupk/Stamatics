 We have various informal sessions to build the bonding amongst the members of department . Experience matters a lot in curriculum and thus interaction between seniors and juniors is promoted. We have sessions for Internship,Placement. At the time of pre-registration we have a session of seniors and juniors to help in choosing the subjects. We also had an session conducted in assistance with Instructor incharge for MTH102 with the students regarding their general questions about subject. We can have such sessions in all subjects if the students ask for.
