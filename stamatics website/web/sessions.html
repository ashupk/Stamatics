	Informal sessions are organised for the students of our department for a healthy interaction with seniors and other members.
	<br>
	Time to time we organise sessions for effective healthy growth and to make the learning environment. <br>
	We have various informal sessions to build the bonding amongst the members of department . Experience matters a lot in curriculum and thus interaction between seniors and juniors is promoted. We have sessions for Internships, Placements. At the time of pre-registration we have sessions for seniors and juniors to help in choosing the subjects.
	<br>
	Stamatics also conducts mentoring sessions with the help of MTH academic mentors primarily for the first year students.
